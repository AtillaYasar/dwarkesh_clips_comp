I'll put some code here that I will write or copypaste from elsewhere, that could help people in this competition.

this is in the spirit of "let's help the competition by giving away the one advantage i may have had (coding ability), ensuring my lazy broke ass definitely doesnt win any money". it's an interesting kind of philosophy :p

screenshot basically sums up current functionality. it just iterates over the list of all of dwarkesh's videos, shows them one at a time (screenshot showing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VeZp2d7mDs&list=UUXl4i9dYBrFOabk0xGmbkRA&index=1&pp=iAQB), and lets you do stuff with them. i guess it's not useful yet for non-coders.
